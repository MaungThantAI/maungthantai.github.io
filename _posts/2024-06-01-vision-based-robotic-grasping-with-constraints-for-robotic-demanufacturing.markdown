We address efficient electronic waste demanufacturing by developing a constraint-aware analytical method for robotic grasping of small domestic appliances. Unlike existing approaches, our method accounts for subsequent disassembly steps, ensuring screws and batteries remain accessible after grasping. The pipeline integrates segmentation, optimal grasp pose estimation, and execution with a parallel-jaw gripper. We validate it in PyBullet simulations with eight objects and lab-scale experiments using a six-axis robot with ten appliances, each over ten trials. Our results demonstrate the potential of constraint-aware analytical grasping for reliable, generalizable, and automated electronic waste demanufacturing.
