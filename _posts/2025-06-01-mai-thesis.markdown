We introduce a novel self-supervised learning framework that jointly captures global and local alignments of visionâ€“language representations in a shared multi-modal space. Models with 200 million parameters are fine-tuned on the MIMIC-CXR dataset and evaluated on both binary and multi-class classification tasks using the RSNA Pneumonia and COVID-19 Radiography (v5) datasets. Our approach is compared against a strong baseline, and an ablation study highlights the contributions of each objective function.
