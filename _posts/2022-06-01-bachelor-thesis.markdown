We designed, implemented, and tested an end-to-end system for detecting and predicting asthma attacks, featuring novel software algorithms and custom hardware chips developed and tested in-house. The system monitors temperature, humidity, breathing rate, coughing, heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, and blood pressure. Additionally, we developed an SQL database and a Java-based smartphone application to track patientsâ€™ medical histories and send emergency notifications to caregivers in the event of an asthma attack. An ESP32 microcontroller is employed to aggregate and process all sensor data.
