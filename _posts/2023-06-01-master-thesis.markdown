We propose a model-independent, non-data-driven method for robotic grasping of 3D electronic devices to automate demanufacturing. Our approach requires no training data yet generalizes to diverse objects while respecting constraints such as screw locations. We validate the method in PyBullet simulations for both single and cluttered object scenes and introduce the self-collected Xorhin Dataset for real-world testing with an Intel RealSense LiDAR Camera L515. Our results demonstrate the potential of non-data-driven approaches for efficient and generalizable automated demanufacturing.
